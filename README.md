# mapio

Your project group's got ten people and you want to have a meeting right now. You message or call each one up, figure out who's free when, find out where each one is and where the optimal place to meet is, and by the end of it all, you're just massively confused. Let MapIO do all that work for you so you can concentrate on the meeting. Simply invite your friends to your online group and MapIO will give you the best places to meet, regardless of whether you want to have the meeting at a quiet park or over dinner at a expensive restaurants.
